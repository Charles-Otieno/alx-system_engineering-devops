   - Benefits: Subdomains enable organizations to organize and manage different services or resources under the main domain.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Different types of DNS records include A records (for IPv4 addresses), AAAA records (for IPv6 addresses), CNAME records (for aliasing), MX records (for mail servers), etc.
   - Implications: Proper DNS configuration ensures reliable and efficient domain resolution, minimizing website downtime and improving user experience.
   - Directions: DNS management focuses on security, performance optimization, and adherence to DNS best practices.

4. What is the role of the web server?
   - Context: A web server is software or hardware that handles HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and delivers web content.
   - Specifics: It serves static files and executes dynamic content generation scripts.
   - Examples: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS.
   - Benefits: Web servers enable website hosting, content delivery, and application deployment.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Different web servers vary in performance, features, security, and resource utilization.
   - Implications: Choosing the right web server impacts website speed, reliability, and security.
   - Directions: Web server development focuses on improving performance, security, and compatibility with emerging web technologies.

5. What is the role of the application server?
   - Context: An application server is software responsible for executing application logic and processing dynamic content.
   - Specifics: It hosts application code and interacts with databases and external services.
   - Examples: Tomcat, WildFly, Node.js.
   - Benefits: Application servers facilitate scalable, robust, and maintainable application development.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Different application servers support various programming languages, frameworks, and deployment models.
   - Implications: Effective application server deployment enhances application performance, scalability, and reliability.
   - Directions: Application server development focuses on improving scalability, fault tolerance, and integration capabilities.

6. What is the role of the database?
   - Context: A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
   - Specifics: It stores website/application data, such as user information, content, and configurations.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
   - Benefits: Databases provide data consistency, integrity, and concurrency control for reliable data management.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Different database types include relational databases, NoSQL databases, and in-memory databases, each suited for specific use cases.
   - Implications: Proper database design and management ensure data security, performance, and scalability.
   - Directions: Database development focuses on optimizing data access, ensuring data privacy, and integrating with other systems.

7.What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
   - Context: The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet to fulfill web requests.
   - Specifics: It uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol for communication.
   - Examples: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3.
   - Benefits: HTTP facilitates efficient and standardized data exchange between clients and servers, enabling seamless web browsing.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: HTTPS adds encryption and authentication to HTTP, ensuring secure communication over the internet.
   - Implications: Proper protocol implementation enhances website security, privacy, and reliability.
   - Directions: Protocol development focuses on improving performance, security, and compatibility with evolving web technologies.

b. Issues with this Infrastructure
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   - Context: The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, making it vulnerable to downtime if the server fails.
   - Specifics: Any hardware or software failure could result in downtime for the website.
   - Examples: Server hardware failure, software crashes, network issues.
   - Benefits: Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms mitigates the risk of SPOF.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Distributed architectures and cloud-based deployments offer higher resilience against SPOF compared to single-server setups.
   - Implications: SPOF increases the risk of service disruption, data loss, and negative user experience.
   - Directions: Redundancy strategies focus on deploying backup servers, load balancing, and disaster recovery planning.

2.Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code, web server needs to be restarted):
   - Context: Performing maintenance activities, such as deploying updates or restarting servers, can result in website downtime.
   - Specifics: Temporary unavailability of website services during maintenance windows affects user accessibility and experience.
   - Examples: Software patches, security updates, application deployments.
   - Benefits: Implementing zero-downtime deployment strategies minimizes service disruption and maintains continuous availability.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Traditional maintenance approaches require scheduled downtime, while modern DevOps practices emphasize continuous delivery and automated deployment pipelines.
   - Implications: Downtime during maintenance windows affects business operations, revenue, and customer satisfaction.
   - Directions: DevOps adoption focuses on implementing automation, CI/CD pipelines, and blue-green deployments to minimize downtime and streamline maintenance processes.

3.Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
   - Context: A single-server setup may struggle to handle a high volume of incoming traffic efficiently.
   - Specifics: Limited server resources, such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, constrain scalability under heavy load.
   - Examples: Traffic spikes due to viral content, marketing campaigns, or seasonal events.
   - Benefits: Scalability ensures consistent performance and availability during peak usage periods.
   - Comparisons or Contrasts: Scalable architectures, such as cloud-based auto-scaling and distributed systems, dynamically allocate resources to meet demand.
   - Implications: Inadequate scalability leads to performance degradation, slow response times, and service unavailability during traffic surges.
   - Directions: Scalability strategies focus on horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, and elasticity to accommodate fluctuating workloads and support business growth.
