a)Specifics about this infrastructure

1.For every additional element, why you are adding it:

   - Load Balancer: Added to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, improving performance, scalability, and reliability. It helps prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed with requests, thus enhancing the overall user experience.
   - Server Redundancy (Server 1 and Server 2): Added for redundancy and fault tolerance. Having multiple servers ensures continuity of service in case one server fails, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability for the website.
   - Database Redundancy (Database 1 and Database 2): Added for data redundancy and fault tolerance. A database cluster ensures that if one database server fails, another can take over, preventing data loss and maintaining data availability.

2. What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works:
   - The load balancer (HAProxy) is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm distributes incoming requests evenly among the available servers sequentially. Each server receives an equal share of the traffic, ensuring a balanced workload and optimal resource utilization.

3. Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
   - The load balancer is enabling an Active-Active setup. In an Active-Active setup, all servers are actively serving traffic simultaneously. This configuration increases fault tolerance, scalability, and efficiency as all servers share the workload. Conversely, in an Active-Passive setup, only one server actively serves traffic while the others remain on standby. Active-Active setups are typically preferred for their better resource utilization and higher availability.

4. How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works:
   - In a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster, there is one primary (master) node and one or more replica (slave) nodes. The primary node handles write operations and serves as the primary source of data. Write operations performed on the primary node are replicated to the replica nodes asynchronously. Replica nodes handle read operations and serve as backups in case the primary node fails. This setup ensures data redundancy, fault tolerance, and high availability.

5. What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application:
   - The primary node is responsible for handling write operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data from the database. It serves as the authoritative source of data and is actively involved in processing application requests that modify the database.
   - The replica nodes, on the other hand, are primarily used for read operations. They serve as standby servers that replicate data from the primary node and can handle read queries from the application. Replica nodes do not accept write operations directly but ensure data availability and load distribution, thus offloading read traffic from the primary node and improving overall application performance.

b. Issue with the last designed infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   - In the provided infrastructure, the Load Balancer represents a potential single point of failure (SPOF). If the Load Balancer fails, it could disrupt the flow of traffic to Server 1 and Server 2, rendering the entire system inaccessible to users.
   - Additionally, if there is only one Database server, it could also be considered a single point of failure. If the Database server experiences downtime or malfunctions, it could lead to data unavailability or loss, impacting the functionality of the entire system.

2. Security Issues:
   - Lack of Firewall: The infrastructure does not include firewalls, leaving the servers vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential cyber-attacks. Firewalls act as a barrier between the servers and external threats, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
   - Absence of HTTPS: Without HTTPS encryption, the communication between users and the website is not secure. This exposes sensitive user data, such as login credentials and personal information, to potential interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors.

3. No Monitoring:
   - The absence of monitoring tools means that there is no real-time visibility into the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure components. Without monitoring, it becomes challenging to detect and address issues such as server downtime, performance bottlenecks, security breaches, or abnormal behavior.
   - Monitoring tools play a crucial role in proactively identifying and resolving issues before they escalate, ensuring the reliability, availability, and security of the web infrastructure.

Addressing these issues is essential to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of the web infrastructure. Implementing redundancy, security measures (such as firewalls and HTTPS encryption), and monitoring solutions can mitigate these risks and enhance the overall resilience of the system.
