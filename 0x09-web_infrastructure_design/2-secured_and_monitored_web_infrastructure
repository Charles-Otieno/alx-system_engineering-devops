a)Here are the explanations for each specific aspect of the infrastructure for every additional element, and why they are added:
   - Firewalls: Firewalls are added to enhance network security by controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic. They act as barriers between the internal network and external threats, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against malicious activities such as hacking attempts, malware infections, and DDoS attacks.
   - SSL Certificate (HTTPS): An SSL certificate is added to enable HTTPS encryption for secure communication between clients (users' browsers) and the web server. HTTPS encrypts data transmitted over the network, ensuring confidentiality and integrity, and protecting sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, and payment details.
   - Monitoring Clients: Monitoring clients are deployed to collect logs and metrics from the infrastructure components. This enables proactive monitoring, fault detection, and performance optimization, ensuring the availability, reliability, and security of the web infrastructure.

b)Some specifics about this infrastructure
-What are firewalls for:
   - Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic to prevent unauthorized access, malware infections, and other security threats.

3. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
   - Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between clients (web browsers) and the web server. HTTPS encrypts data transmitted over the network, protecting it from eavesdropping, interception, and tampering. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information exchanged between users and the website, such as login credentials, personal data, and financial transactions.

4. What monitoring is used for:
   - Monitoring is used to track the performance, availability, and security of the web infrastructure. It involves collecting and analyzing data from various components, such as servers, networks, applications, and databases, to identify and address issues proactively. Monitoring helps detect anomalies, optimize resource utilization, troubleshoot problems, and ensure optimal performance and user experience.

5. How the monitoring tool is collecting data:
   - The monitoring tool collects data through agents or data collectors deployed on the infrastructure components. These agents gather logs, metrics, and other performance data from servers, applications, databases, and network devices. The collected data is then processed, analyzed, and visualized by the monitoring tool to generate insights, alerts, and reports for administrators and operators.

6. Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
   - To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), configure monitoring tools to collect relevant metrics related to server performance, such as HTTP request counts or database query rates. Set up monitoring alerts based on predefined thresholds for QPS metrics to track and manage server load effectively. Adjust thresholds as needed to ensure optimal performance and prevent overloading or downtime.

7. Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue:
   - Terminating SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) at the load balancer level can be problematic because it exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, increasing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. If SSL termination occurs at the load balancer, sensitive data transmitted between the load balancer and the web servers is no longer encrypted, potentially compromising confidentiality and integrity.

8. Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
   - Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes poses a single point of failure risk. If the server fails, it can lead to data loss, service interruption, or degraded performance. Implementing replication and failover mechanisms can mitigate this risk by ensuring data redundancy, high availability, and automatic failover in the event of a primary server failure.

9. Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem:
   - Deploying servers with identical components increases vulnerability to common failures or security breaches. If all servers have the same configuration, a single vulnerability or software flaw could affect all servers simultaneously, leading to widespread service disruptions or compromise. Diversifying server roles and configurations can enhance fault tolerance and reduce the impact of potential issues.
